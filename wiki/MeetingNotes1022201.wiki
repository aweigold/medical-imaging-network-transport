    * Working on DICOM2MINT C++ implementation - functional
    * Working with Fred to use CURL to send metadata + binary items over to MINT server
    * Using STL for map, iterators, etc
    * Using GDCM to parse DICOM in C++
  * Jim
    * Call with RSNA leadership (Chair WG6/WG10/Secretary)
      * Very good meeting 
      * WG27 meeting Monday of RSNA (Nov 29) from 9-5 in room M128 
      * Presenting to the DICOM standards committee on Thursday Dec 2nd at RSNA
    * Made progress on MINT marketing 
      * Tim sent out poster mockup to list
      * Looking into putting "gotmint.org" stickers on york peppermint patties
  * Tim Dawson
    * Worked on MINT poster
    * Planning on SDK
    * Going to restructure the source code repository over weekend
  * Dan Chafee
    * Refactored data dictionary so it is in metadata project
    * Started working on normalization using the data dictionary for DICOM2MINT
    * Working with Gorkem and Tim Culp on updating ClearCanvas plugin to work with XML instead of XHTML.  Will continue to work on this next week
  * Jeremey
    * Started refactoring build process
    * Checked in common build file and clean task
    * Working on compile and test tasks now
  * Chris Hafey
    * Met with Philips to discuss MINT
      * Suggest we add more info about chagelog for notification to technical overview
      * Wondering why we had such limited query capability
  
  
= Notes =
  * Jim suggested that we look at how MINT can fulfill WG27 NADO and QIDO functionality
  * Chris proposed that we make the binary item size exact, not max size and include all attributes past pixel data.  There is evidence that tags are used past 7fe0,0010 and it is better to be safe here.
  
= Decisions =
  * MINT will include tags past 7FE0,0010
  * MINT will specify the exact size of the binary item (bsize)

  * Performance cookbook (Gorkem + Chris + All)
  * Develop integration tests (Jim + Tim Culp)
  * Add support for non DICOM types (Chris)
    * Data dictionaries for Vital Volumes
