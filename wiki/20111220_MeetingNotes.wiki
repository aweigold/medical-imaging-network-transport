= Transfer Syntax for pixel data =
  * WADO uses URL parameter
  * REST best practices use 'accept' header
  * should WADO-RS accept either or both? if we allow URL, most people will use this
  * regardless, response content-type will say what they're getting
  * if no requested type, just gives what is specified in metadata
  * similar to DICOM, support for multiple transfer syntaxes is optional, must support little-endian unless image is only available lossy
