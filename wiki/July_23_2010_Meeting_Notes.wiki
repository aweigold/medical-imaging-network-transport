Agenda
  * Progress this week
  * Bulk Binary Loading Mechanism
  * August Meeting @ JHU
  * RSNA Demo



Notes
  * Progress this week
    * JHU DMZ Server
      * Is up and running, but having trouble getting the MINT server to run on it
    * MINT Implementation
      * Added study search
      * Added change log at study and global level, removed atom feed
      * Started work on data dictionary
      * Most of the implementation will be done soon
    * MINT2DICOM Issues
      * Jack had to write code to build DCM4CHE objects from the MINT objects
      * Jack suggested that MINT build DCM4CHE objects directly instead of intermediate objects
      * Jack check in code, ask for help if can't get access
    * Conformance Testing
      * Tim Culp completed Iteration 2 of conformance test checked in
      * Tim Culp working on Iteration 3, hoping to complete next week
  * New JHU team member joining MINT effort - Gorkem Sevinc, Jack Vining leaving next week.
  * Bulk Binary Loading
    * Concern about URL length - IE has a limit of 2k?
    * Idea - POST collection of BIDs, server returns the ones requested
    * Idea - Add a BID Collection to the server somehow so you can get that collection in one shot
    * Tim asked for feedback on the bulk mechanism return them in the order of the metadata
      * Chris raised a concern about race condition
      * Rick mentioned that it would be advantageous to let the server return the BIDs in the order it wanted
  * Multiple Update Concurrency
    * Locking and serializing updates
    * Do simplest/safest approach now, revisit at JHU meeting
      * Add study version number, updates include that version number - if not correct, fail update
  * Data Dictionary Version
    * How to handle updates? Deal with at JHU meeting
    * Tim Dawson has an example XML for the data dictionary.  Currently in SVN
  * August meeting @ JHU
    * August 16 & 17
    * Send Jim email about hotel information
  * RSNA Demo
    * Ideas
      * Demo in vendors booths
        * Question about RSNA's network performance
        * Concern about cost to connect to RSNA's network ($1500)
      * Put a VM of each MINT server/viewer up in the DMZ so people can access it
      * Generic Poster for MINT User Group in the educational area
        * Logos for each vendor supporting MINT
        * Server with VM's for demoing
        * Code walk through for reference implementation
      * Setup meetings with key DICOM individuals to discuss MINT
      * Got MINT Campaign?  Vendors could give out actual mints wrapped with MINT logo/URL
       
Decisions
  * Do more design work on Bulk Binary Loading at August JHU working meeting
  * Do more design work on data dictionary versioning at JHU working meeting
  * Do more design work on multiple update concurrent at JHU Working meeting
  * Decided to omit attribute if the value was empty

  * Jim to send out JHU august working meeting information to mailing list
