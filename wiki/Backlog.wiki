#summary Backlog of features/ideas for MINT

= Backlog =
  * How to handle study deletion
  * Add support for querying by Universal Entity ID (0040,0032) and Universal Entity ID Type (0040,0033)
  * Explore mechanism to allow binary item access via a different URI than the one relative to the metadata.  The idea here is to allow a client to read the binary data directly from where it is being stored rather than going through a proxy.  A few use cases:
    * Store the binary items in an HTTP storage system like Caringo or Dell Object store.  Performance is improved if the client can read the binary item directly
    * A de-identification service could implement the MINT api and serve up de-identified metadata but allow the client to retrieve the binary items directly from the MINT service.  Performance would be improved
