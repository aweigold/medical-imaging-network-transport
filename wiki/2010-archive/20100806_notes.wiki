Agenda
  * Progress this week
  * August Meeting @ JHU
  * RSNA Demo

Notes
  * Progress this week
    * Reference Implementation
      * Added inline binary data in metadata (not tested yet)
    * Bulk Loading
      * Performance concerns using the 'all' request and sequence request (0-141000)
        * Need to speed up the time to initial response by server
    * MINT2DICOM
      * Issue with knowing when attribute value is binary or text
      * Gorkem is getting some weird problems using Jack's MINT2DICOM process
    * Conformance Testing
      * Added verbose flag and lazy flag
        * verbose gives feedback to let you know it's working
        * lazy flag bypasses the binary data compare
    * Got Gorkem up to speed at Harris meeting
    * JHU DMZ Server
      * Loaded with some larger test studies
      * Small studies, not issues but larger study Gorkem is getting a "stream closed" issue and will reach max thread count
      * Server memory needs to be increased in order to manage large studies (more that 2GB)
        * Problem may be HTTP client library is caching the data which is rediculous, may need to replace it
  * August working meeting at JHU
    * Jim sent out email announcement
    * Jim invited with other vendors 
  * Sent out JHU SVN URL
    * Gorkem posted Anonymized Test Data Sets in DICOM P10 to JHU SVN Server
    * Subversion replicates data into .svn files on checkout, confuses CC and other loaders
  * Chris asked vital RSNA folks about RSNA network performance/cost
    * Very expensive, will talk more about this on the 17th
   
Decisions
  * Gorkem to stand up a FTP server to distribute the data
  * Gorkem to work on CC Bulk Loading
  * Data dictionary should define the data type of an attribute in order to determine if data is binary or text

New Actions
  * Gorkem to stand up a FTP server to distribute the data
  * Rex to implement performance enhancements on bulk binaryitems retrieval (speeding up sequence request)


Old Actions
  * Characterizing bulk loading performance as implemented today in vital av [Chris Hafey]
  * Update the MINT metadata document with which VRs are candidates for binary items and the option to encode in base 64 and version number and type for study meta [Chris Hafey]
  * Send out address of JHU MINT Server to Rick [Chris Hafey]
  * Package up MINT Compatible Clear Canvas as a ZIP and post [Chris Hafey]
  * Gorkem to run dvtk on original DICOM files vs regenerated files
  * Investigate using SVN tags on source files like we have on conformance files (Tim Dawson) (eclipse may make this easy)
  * Define performance test environment (Jim Philbin)
  * Setup Performance Test Environment (Jim Philbin)
  * Provide anonymous FTP site to access data sets (Gorkem)
  * Create MINT2DICOM Converter (Gorkem)
  * Iteration 3 rev2 (sequencing data elements, bulk loading, inline binary encoding) Conformance Test (Tim Culp)
  * MINT Server Implementation - Phase 2 (Tim Dawson)
