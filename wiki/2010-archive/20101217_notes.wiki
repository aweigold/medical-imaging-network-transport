= Notes =
  * Discussion on version number for metadata
    * XSD has this as optional
    * Should we default it to zero if not supplied?
    * Main reason it exists is to deal with update conflicts
    * It might be possible to support adds without requiring a version number

= Decisions =
  * Change XSD such that version is required (not optional)
  * Metadata version shall be zero when creating a study
  * All study changes (additions, updates or deletes) will reference the metadata version the change is made against
