#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Progress Since Last Meeting =
  * Gorkem
    * Working on MINT C++ library
      * Is generating XML
      * Next step is to normalize data
      * Vital suggested looking at Arabica for C++ XML handling
    * Worked with Dan to determine clear canvas plugin is not functioning
      * Thinks this is happening because the namespace was removed from the summary page
      * Gorkem will work on this later but before RSNA
    * Measured 110 MB/s over Gig/e on CentOS (tomcat)
      * Measured Multi-part MIME vs blob and performance was very close
      * Measured multi-part mime in single file vs multi-file and performance was very close
  * Jim
    * Connected with Howard Clark (Secretary of DICOM) to schedule a call on MINT
  * Chris
    * Posted a MINT FAQ
    * Recommend new REST book "REST in Practice"
    * Considering a talk for SIIM - build your own web based image viewer using MINT and WADO
  * Tim Dawson
    * Changes to stylesheets are pending
      * Search form
    * Did review Dan's data dictionary code
      * Suggest we rename mintmetadata into mintsdk
      * Will send out an email on this
    * Believes all actions assigned to him is done
  * Dan Chaffey
    * Working on performance testing, numbers are now posted
      * Server 2008 numbers only
      * Still waiting on 2003 and linux
      * Measured 70% performance boost using IIS and ISAPI
      * Not getting same numbers as Vital, but similar percent speedup
    * Not started on data dictionary based normalization
    * Tim culp updated conformance test with Gorkem's single file
  * Jeremy
    * Nothing to report

= Handling multi-frame = 
  * MINT does not currently support encapsulated formats - needed when pixel data is compressed (e.g. via JPEG)
  * Problem getting the binary item size for multiframe - requires a full read of the pixel data to figure this out (which is expensive compared to what we do today)
  * If MINT specification requires the binary item size then all implementations will have to incur the full read cost to generate metadata
  * Josh Coleman from Vital suggested that it is possible to get an estimate of the image size by calculating it based on other fields (rows, columns, bits per pixel, etc).  Says that IHE suggests this?
  * Options to consider:
    * Require bsize to be always be present
    * Make bsize optional
    * Make bsize required for everything but encapsulated formats
    * Remove bsize
    * Have two attributes - one is exactSize and another is noBiggerThanSize
    * Change meaning to be "noBiggerThanSize" - actual bytes may be less but will not exceed
  * Question about whether or not size is for a single item or for all items
    * Suggest we make it for all items
  * Possible problem if there are private tags after the pixel data
    * Theoretically this is possible, but in practice does it happen?
  * NOTE: MINT2DICOM will not generate a 100% identical original DICOM file with encapsulated formats are used due to fragments, etc unless we decide to store this data somehow.  We will generate semantically equivalent DICOM instances, but they will not be bit for bit equivalent
 
= Notes =

= Decisions =
  * _Binary items will have a required attribute named "noBiggerThanSize" which is either equal to the binary item size or greater than._  *NOTE - This was decision was overruled during the 10222010 meeting*
