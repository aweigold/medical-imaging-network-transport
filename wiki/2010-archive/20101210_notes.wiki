    * Performance of MINT vs DCM4CHE.  
      * MINT is working at line speed on download, good on upload
      * DCM4CHE seems to be downloading at line speed
      * Planning to post results soon
  * Chris Hafey
    * Present to WG27 at RSNA
      * Overall feedback was good
      * We learned a lot about how the DICOM standard process works
        * DICOM works on smaller units of work that MINT
          * MINT probably would turn into about 7-8 work items
        * Need to see which of these work items overlap with existing standard 
  * Tim Culp
    * Looking at the integration test framework
      * Application framework that tests at a higher level than unit testing
    * Presented to the MINT demo on Monday evening
      * Demonstrated DICOM2MINT, MINT2DICOM, ClearCanvas and Conformance Test
    * Fixed a one line bug to MINT2DICOM, needs to be included in V1.0
    * Command line tools need to exit with error codes so scripts can take actions accordingly
  * Dan Chaffe
    * Modified DICOM2MINT to get data dictionary from MINT server
  * Tim Dawson
    * Has not tagged source code yet
    * Source tree has been cleaned up (Thanks to Uli)
    * Need to create a deployable WAR file and start scripts, etc
    * Suggesting creating a step by step guide about how to setup and use MINT
      * Gorkem has written this up already in SVN at top level of repo (word doc)
  * Damien Evans
    * Emmanuel reported that WG27 was looking at MINT at the DICOM standards committee
    * Has heard that people think its a good idea and want to know when its ready to use
    * People are curious about it and are interested in things that improve performance
