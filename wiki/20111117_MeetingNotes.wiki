= Open items from email list =
  * Content negotiation
    today cannot do this; must be optional, would allow vendor differentiation
  * HTTP caching & Accept header vs. REST resource
    need to research different caches; Dan will send a link
    one idea: allow accept header & redirect to REST resource
  * DICOM UT value representation
    agree with Uli's recommendation...
    Jonathan - look at UT tags in part19 XML
  * Non-DICOM types & hierarchy
    nested folder structures seems like a reasonable approach

  * define detailed agenda
  * open issues for MINT 2.0
