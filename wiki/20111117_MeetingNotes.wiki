#summary MINT meeting Nov 17, 2011.

= Agenda =
  * Open items from email list
  * Supplement 148 changes for RSNA
  * MINT Meeting @ RSNA

= Open items from email list =
  * Content negotiation
    cannot do this today, but would be possible using HTTP accept header.
    this would increase the cost of implementing MINT if we required transformations, so it must be optional - which would allow vendor differentiation
  * HTTP caching - Accept header vs. REST resource
    need to research different caches; Dan will send a link
    one idea: allow accept header & redirect to REST resource with content type
  * DICOM UT value representation
    agree with Uli's recommendation... UT should be inline if small, otherwise externalized into a binary item. same basic rules as small binary items, but no need to base64 encode (do need to encode to prevent embedded characters causing xml problems)
    Jonathan - look at UT tags in part19 XML
  * Non-DICOM types & hierarchy
    first draft had just a single level of files underneath a type
    this is too restrictive and would cause vendors to create a lot of different types
    nested folder structures seems like a reasonable approach
    still need to talk about type registration

= Supplement 148 changes for RSNA - open issues =
  * what metadata schema will we use? WG-27 desires use of part19
    * concern of non-normalized metadata
    * XPATH is problematic
    * enh. multiframe conversion may attack this
    * need a shorthand mapping of ID within a study to a UID representing an instance/frame
  * returning a range of SOP instances
    * do we need to specify multiple, or can we filter on a series?
    * cannot do range of UIDs, need a list
  * HTTP accept headers
    * application/dicom vs. application/wado
    * for transfer syntaxes? application/dicom/xferSyntax?
  * private metadata
    * how does 3.19 handle private XML tags?
  * Metadata/info vs. XPath
    * xpath puts burden on users to create XPath, on server to apply 
    * performance impact
    * cannot cache study info
    * however, xpath does provide advantage of allowing client choice
  * Parameters vs. resource
    * URL length, caching resource
