#summary MINT meeting Nov 17, 2011.

= Agenda =
  * Open items from email list
  * Supplement 148 changes for RSNA
  * MINT Meeting @ RSNA

= Open items from email list =
  * Content negotiation
    today cannot do this; must be optional, would allow vendor differentiation
  * HTTP caching & Accept header vs. REST resource
    need to research different caches; Dan will send a link
    one idea: allow accept header & redirect to REST resource
  * DICOM UT value representation
    agree with Uli's recommendation...
    Jonathan - look at UT tags in part19 XML
  * Non-DICOM types & hierarchy
    nested folder structures seems like a reasonable approach

= Supplement 148 changes for RSNA - open issues =
  * what metadata schema will we use? WG-27 desires use of part19
    * concern of non-normalized metadata
    * XPATH is problematic
    * enh. multiframe conversion may attack this
    * need a shorthand mapping of ID within a study to a UID representing an instance/frame
  * returning a range of SOP instances
    * do we need to specify multiple, or can we filter on a series?
    * cannot do range of UIDs, need a list
  * HTTP accept headers
    * application/dicom vs. application/wado
    * for transfer syntaxes? application/dicom/xferSyntax?
  * private metadata
    * how does 3.19 handle private XML tags?
  * Metadata/info vs. XPath
    * xpath puts burden on users to create XPath, on server to apply 
    * performance impact
    * cannot cache study info
    * however, xpath does provide advantage of allowing client choice
  * Parameters vs. resource
    * URL length, caching resource
