Agenda
  * Progress this week
  * August Meeting @ JHU
  * RSNA Demo

Notes
  * Progress this week
    * Reference Implementation
      * Bug fixes (missing files)
      * Did not implement binary item optimizations
      * In memory lock of study on updates is implemented by Rex
    * Bulk Loading
      * Bulk loading added to reference implementation last week
      * Vital did add bulk loading to their AV client
      * Initial performance testing was lower than we had hoped - around 50 MB/s
      * Need to do testing using real hardware and investigate further
    * MINT2DICOM
      * Not a perfect conversion - losing 2 or 3 elements
      * Jack is investigating to see which elements and why
      * Could be DICOM Part 10 Header attributes?
      * Jack reports that the regenerated dicom images do not load into ClearCanvas
      * Chris suggested to make sure the transfer syntax uid is set, otherwise it may not display properly
      * Gorkem confirmed that the dropped attributes are Part 10 header items and the transfer syntax is not set
    * Conformance Testing
      * Tim Culp uploaded first rev of iteration 3
      * Iteration 2 = Mint study compare (MINT 2 MINT)
      * Iteration 3 = Mint DICOM Compare (MINT 2 DICOM) 
      * Updated to skip over attributes with group < 8
      * Finding that some VRs are showing up as text in MINT, not as BIDs
      * Need to finalize which VRs are binary items
      * How to handle implicit transfer syntaxes - vital is using a DICOM standard based data dictionary for this mapping
      * Question about supporting sequences - yes they are implemented/supported
      * Todo
        * sequences
        * multi-frame
        * conformance test after update
      * What should validator do with bad DICOM?  Nothing...
        * Importer should reject or at least log/warn if DICOM is bad (wrong VR)
    * JHU DMZ Server
      * Up and running with MINT! (VM)
      * Separate server running SVN (VM)
        * Will be used as a source code backup
        * Will be used to hold data sets
        * How to setup to mirror/sync from google code svn? 
      * Could use TRAC for issue tracking 
  * August working meeting at JHU
    * Jim to send out email announcement
    * Share invite with other vendors 
    * Start at 10 AM Monday Morning
    * Dinner Monday evening
    * Agenda
      * Overview / demo
        * Hope to demo on high speed networks (infiniband, 10gig)
      * Code/design walkthrough
      * Review implementation challenges
      * Design meetings
      * Roadmap planning
      * RSNA
       
  * Root level XML tag
    * Currently says "StudyMeta" - should we rename it to "MINTStudyMeta"
    * Should add a version number as an attribute
    * Should add the type as as an attribute (e.g. DICOM or proprietary)
    * Should we use XML namespaces for this?
   
Decisions
  * Data dictionary VR will be used for tags if it sent in as unknown
  * For reference implementation, we will encode binary items inline in the XML as base64 if they are less than 100 bytes
  * From a standard point of view, a binary item could be encoded as base 64 or extracted as a separate binary item id
  * Gorkem to work on CC Bulk Loading
  * Add version number and type to the MINT Metadata

New Actions
  * Characterizing bulk loading performance as implemented today in vital av [Chris Hafey]
  * Update the MINT metadata document with which VRs are candidates for binary items and the option to encode in base 64 and version number and type for study meta [Chris Hafey]
  * Send out address of JHU MINT Server to Rick [Chris Hafey]
  * Send out JHU SVN URL [Gorkem]
  * Package up MINT Compatible Clear Canvas as a ZIP and post [Chris Hafey]
  
Old Actions
  * Jim to send out JHU august working meeting information to mailing list
  * Jim to talk to invite other vendors to come to August JHU meeting
  * Chris to ask vital RSNA folks about RSNA network performance/cost
  * Gorkem to run dvtk on original DICOM files vs regenerated files
  * Investigate using SVN tags on source files like we have on conformance files (Tim Dawson)
  * Define performance test environment (Jim Philbin)
  * Setup Performance Test Environment (Jim Philbin)
  * Post Anonymized Test Data Sets in DICOM P10 to JHU SVN Server (Gorkem)
  * Provide anonymous FTP site to access data sets (Jim Philbin)
  * Create MINT2DICOM Converter (Gorkem)
  * Iteration 1,2 & 3 Conformance Test (Tim Culp)
  * MINT Server Implementation - Phase 2 (Tim Dawson)
