#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

= Progress Since Last Meeting =
  * Gorkem
    * Running performance tests, but is seeing weird numbers
    * Need to rerun performance tests once cause variance is understood
    * Refactoring MINT2DICOM
    * Started implementing single file in reference impl
      * Would be really helpful to have the size of the binary item in the metadata
    * HTTP Chunk size configuration is only sticking when communicating over localhost, it is ignored when communicating over the LAN.
      * Probably a Tomcat configuration issue? 
  * Rex
    * Not much progress, mainly catching up with things and bringing Dan up to speed
    * Needs to move data dictionary to POJOs - currently assigned to Tim.  REx going to work with Dan to see if he can pick this up
  * Tim Culp
    * Not much progress, on vacation
    * Updated conformance test to use data dictionary to use VRs/tag names
    * Started working on Toshiba multi-frame image, cause some performance/memory issues - hope to finish next week

  * Chris
    * Started building our own performance test environment - focused on Gig/E
    * Installed MINT on Apple XServe, found performance problems
    * Is anyone trying to run MINT on non windows?  Yes - Gorkem is trying to get it working on Solaris, having some difficulty with environment variables.  Tim Culp is running the conformance test on Linux - no issues yet
