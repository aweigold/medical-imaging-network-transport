<body>

Provides data structures for storing data in MINT format, such as DICOM metadata and other types of data.

These classes serve several purposes:
<ul>
<li> Attribute normalization, both in terms of pre-defined Study-level/Series-level attributes
    and ad-hoc series-level normalization.</li>
<li> Separating and maintaining the binary data in the format we need.</li>
<li> Easily serializing the data to XML and GPB.</li>
<li> Usage as direct input for programmatic retrieval and manipulation of MINT-based DICOM data and other data,
    for example from a third-party application.</li>
</ul>
