# MINT

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/medical-imaging-network-transport/medical-imaging-network-transport.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/medical-imaging-network-transport/medical-imaging-network-transport)

Mission Statement
=================
Our mission is to improve medical imaging by addressing the need for fast, easy and interoperable access to unified medical imaging records. We will achieve this by defining interim standards and creating production quality open source implementations that leverage web and other new technologies. We will collaborate with vendors to validate solutions in the real world, and work with existing industry standards bodies (DICOM, IHE, HL7) to incorporate and standardize these new approaches.

Current Status
--------------
The MINT Leadership team is currently working as part of DICOM WG-27 to define RESTful DICOM standards that incorporate the benefits achieved by MINT into the DICOM standard. WADO-RS, QIDO-RS, and STOW-RS are the first three initiatives. These will all be incorporated as part of MINT 2.0.

MINT 1.0
--------
For information about MINT 1.0, please see the [release page](https://github.com/medical-imaging-network-transport/medical-imaging-network-transport/releases/tag/1.0.2)

This github site serves as the official location for the specification of the MINT standard as well as source code for a reference implementation of the standard.
